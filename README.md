# atom-update
Simple script for update or install atom (https://atom.io/)

This script will check if you have installed atom and which version is installed.
It will also download information about last release from atom github repository.

If you will confirm installation or update then it will download a package from official site (via HTTPS with enabled certificate control) and install it.

The script can handle debian based and Red Hat based distribution.

Running on debian isn't well tested, so please let me know if you will discover any problem.
